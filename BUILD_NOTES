Make install isn't present since you have to run it from the build directory (script_data, image_data, and map_data)
If you cannot compile it with clang++, try clang++-X.Y where X is the major version and Y is the minor version.
   I do all of my builds with the latest stable version in the Ubuntu PPA (3.6 at the time of writing).
The default build has debugging flags enabled. If you want to speed up the code, you can use your own custom flags with the ADD macro).
Every once in a while, I try compiling and running the code with different flags to see if anything wonky happens.
Sometimes, I might push non-working code into the repo. I realize this and push a fix a minute later most of the time.
