Since the array system is very minimal, I would like to make multiple ports to send the data over since I am too lazy to write some packet ID code:
	50000 will be for the class data
	50002 will be for the connection data along with everything else

Most of what I removed was common sense.
There is no vector networking.
These vectors will have a constant size and they will not change after initialization. 
	This will at least let me network with them.

I believe all of the engines can be ran in their own thread, which is nice.

IDEA:
	Allow patching the map in real time through the server console.
	The entire obj file will be loaded into one string. This gets put back into a file, the patch gets applied, and the object is reloaded
