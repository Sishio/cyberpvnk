Hey, let's not use the headers for the types anymore because I have a better idea:
	Let's make one array of all of the arrays
	The client will search through all of the arrays to find a matching ID
	It feeds the data into the correspoinding array

Since the array system is very minimal, I would like to make multiple ports to send the data over since I am too lazy to write some packet ID code:
	50000 will be for the class data
	50002 will be for the connection data along with everything else



here is an idea:
	all of the std::vectors go into different arrays
	the size of the arrays is attatched to the packets where the data is needed
	this data will be read off and it will check to see if the size is the same
	IF IT IS THE SAME, do not do anything
	IF IT IS TOO SMALL OR TO LARGE, change it and continue on with reading the data off
	if there is a change, the data will have to be
	the array has a pointer to the update array function it will use when the data changes sizes

So long as we do not keep pointers and only use the ID thing, there should be no reason to keep any of the classes connected in code. They send themselves over and the software will take care of the rest.
