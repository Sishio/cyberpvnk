Hey, let's not use the headers for the types anymore because I have a better idea:
	Let's make one array of all of the arrays
	The client will search through all of the arrays to find a matching ID
	It feeds the data into the correspoinding array

Since the array system is very minimal, I would like to make multiple ports to send the data over since I am too lazy to write some packet ID code:
	50000 will be for the class data
	50002 will be for the connection data along with everything else
