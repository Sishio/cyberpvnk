The maps here are extracted from all of the array_t entries that are needed for this to work.
That means these files aren't really editable by hand. You would probably need a hex editor or something like that for this to work.
	The seperators I use aren't legitimate ASCII characters, so the hex editor is the only guaranteed way they can be edited by hand.
